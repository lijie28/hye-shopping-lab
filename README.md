Backend: [https://j3uvhhijq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/hye](https://j3uvhhijq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/hye).

### Key Points
1. Products and prices images are in `public` folder.
2. Products meta data are configured in `src/product_config.json`.
3. When user opens the page, they should see a randomized view based on the `product` and `price` match.
4. The user activity is tracked from the mouse **move in** and **move out** epoch timestamp in each UI section.
5. When checkout, the user should obtain a testing ID like `011220q3fx0s`, it is `version` and `session_id` combination.
6. The user should not allow to refresh the page, even if it is to do so, will also post the already filled data to API.
